Cats vs Dogs Classifier
========================

First attempt at local Pytorch CUDA utilization for training using WSL2.

Classic CNN binary classification using custom data loader and custom image set of cats and dogs

Trained using:
- AMD Ryzen 3700x
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super
- Python 3.8.X
- WSL2 on Windows 11

Hardware limitations bounded by CPU throughput of data loading
